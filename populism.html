            As a Hungarian citizen, I have a deep intered in <span class="populism-highlight">Populism</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interest is due to the fact that Viktor Orb&aacute;n, the current Prime Minister, and his right-wing party, Fidesz, have consolidated their power and hold on Hungary's institutions through populist rhetoric.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="populism-description">
        <p>
            Since 2010, when Fidesz won a supermajority in Hungary's Parliament (despite barely attaining a majority vote in the national elections that year), it has introduced a new constitution, passed an "anti-pedophilia" law, and affiliated itself with or acquired upwards of 90% of the country's media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these initiatives, Orb&aacute;n and Fidesz have consolidated their hold on power and restructured the judiciary (relieving it of its independence from the rest of the Hungarian state), both rhetorically and legally equated LGBTQ+ individuals with pedophilia through the anti-pedophilia law, and transformed the previously free media environment into one constantly repeating the Fidesz line.
